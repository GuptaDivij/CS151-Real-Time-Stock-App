 **Real Time Stock App**

**State the problem/issue:**

The problem we aim to address is the need for a real-time stock tracking application that provides users with up-to-date information on stock prices, trends, and news. Many existing stock tracking applications suffer from delayed data updates, lack of user-friendly interfaces, or limited functionality. Our goal is to create a comprehensive solution that offers real-time data updates, intuitive user interfaces, and a wide range of features to assist users in making informed investment decisions.

**Previous Works:**

Several stock tracking applications exist in the market, such as Robinhood, Yahoo Finance, and Bloomberg Terminal. These platforms offer various features for tracking stocks, including real-time data updates, customizable watchlists, and news feeds [1][2][3].

**Assumptions/Operating Environments/Intended Usage:**

Users will require a stable internet connection to receive real-time updates. 

Intended users are investors and traders who rely on accurate and timely stock market information

**High-Level Description of Solution:**

Our solution involves developing a real-time stock tracking application with a user-friendly interface, customizable watchlists, comprehensive stock data, and timely news updates. We plan to utilize java and javafx to create this application.

**Functionalities:**

Real-time Stock Data Updates: The application will fetch real-time stock prices and market data from reliable sources.

Customizable Watchlists: Users can create personalized watchlists to track their favorite stocks and receive alerts for price changes.

News Feed Integration: The app will include a news feed feature to provide users with the latest market news and analysis.

Technical Analysis Tools: Advanced charting tools and technical indicators will be available for users to perform in-depth analysis of stock trends - give out graphs and charts to further investigate a stockâ€™s history.

Portfolio Management: Users can manage their investment portfolios, track performance, and view historical data.
